            <h1>Cailan</h1>
           <p> Cailan! We finally made it, love. I wish you were here to join me, and I know you'd be proud.
               Anytime that I doubted myself, whether it came to my school work, my hair, or my body image, you lifted me up. 
               I love how, anytime I came home to visit, we were always trying to get into something togetherâ€”whether it was doing each other's hair (or I should say having me do your hair because you never wanted to do mine), dying it different colors, or going out for munchie snack runs. It was always something with us two. I miss us telling each other dark jokes that definitely shouldn't have been funny, but with our dark humor, it didn't bother us. 
               I miss the times when all we had to do to laugh was to look at each other, but now I can't look at your picture without my eyes tearing up and my chest feeling heavy. I know in Isaiah 57:1-2 it says, "Good people pass away; the godly often die before their time, but no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to understand that God is protecting them from the evil to come. For those who follow godly paths will rest in peace when they die," but that doesn't ease the pain. You will forever be in my heart, and I will forever carry a piece of you with me everywhere I go.
               I love you, and I can't wait until the day I'll get to see you again.
