           <p> CAILAN! we finally made it love. I wish you were here to join me and I know you'd be proud. Anytime that
                i doubted myself whether it came to my school work, my hair , my body image..You lifted me up. I love how any time
                i came home to visit, we were always trying to get into something together..whether it was doing each others hair
                (or i should say having me do your hair because you never wanted to do mine), dying it different colors, going out for  munchie
                snack runs,... it was always something with us two. I miss us telling each other dark jokes that definetely shouldn't of been funny 
                but with our dark humor it didnt bother us. I miss the times that all we had to do to laugh was to look at each other , but now i cant
                look at your picture without my eyes tearing up and my chest feeling heavy. I know in Isaiah 57:1-2 it says "Good people pass away; the godly 
                often die before their time, but no one seems to care or wonder why. No one seems to understand that God is protecting them from the evil to come.
                For those who follow godly paths will rest in peace when they die." , but that doesnt ease the pain. You will forever be in my heart and i will
                forever carry a piece of you with me everywhere i go. I love you and i cant wait until the day ill get to see you again soon.
