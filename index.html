                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I have always harbored a passion and fascination for technology, a fervor that first ignited during my high school years. During this time, I made the decision to enroll in dual credit classes with the goal of obtaining my Microsoft Office Specialist Certificate.

As time progressed, I embarked on a self-guided journey to learn coding in the comfort of my home, and the trajectory only ascended from there. Admittedly, it took me a while to summon the courage to step outside my comfort zone, but once I took that initial leap, it became challenging for me to halt the momentum.

At present, I find fulfillment in imparting coding skills to children, covering a spectrum of languages from HTML and CSS to Python. As Steve Jobs aptly stated, "Have the courage to do what your heart and intuition tell you to do."</p>
