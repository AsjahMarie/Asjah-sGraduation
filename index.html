                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>  I have always been passionate and intrigued when it came to technology. It started in highschool when i decided to take 
                    dual credit computer science classes to get my microsoft office specialist certificate. After a while, i began to teach myself how to code and it just went up 
                    hill from there, it took me a while to step out of my comfort zone to do it, but once i started it was hard for me to stop.

                <h3>To My Biggest Support System!</h3>
                <p>Thank you guys for all you have done for me during my schooling journey!
                    We all know that this has been a long time coming but the time is finally here.
                    Through the basic pre-reqs, to spending so much time in nursing, to social work then finally deciding on what i should've started with...Computer Science!
                    I love you guys with all of my heart and couldnt of done it without you whether you "made a impact" or not.Just being there was more than enough.
                    -Thank you.
                </p>
