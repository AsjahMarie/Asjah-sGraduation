                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>  I have always been passionate and intrigued when it came to technology. It started in highschool when i decided to take 
                    dual credit computer science classes to get my microsoft office specialist certificate. After a while, i began to teach myself how to code and it just went up 
                    hill from there, it took me a while to step out of my comfort zone to do it, but once i started it was hard for me to stop.
