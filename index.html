                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p> Hey Family and Friends! Graduation time is near! This is the website I've created for all of my loved ones to get their tickets or receive the link to watch the graduation online! Tickets are <strong>Limited</strong>. 
                    If you do not receive your ticket after submitting the form with your contact information, then all of the available tickets have been taken. But don't worry, you can still watch me cross the stage online in real time!

                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>My love for tech started back in high school when I dove into dual credit classes, aiming for that Microsoft Office Specialist Certificate. Later on, I decided to teach myself coding from the cozy corners of my home, and once I took that first leap out of my comfort zone, there was no turning back. Now, I get a kick out of teaching kids how to code, covering everything from HTML and CSS to Python. It's like Steve Jobs said, "Have the courage to do what your heart and intuition tell you to do."</p>
