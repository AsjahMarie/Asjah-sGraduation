              <p>Thank you guys for all you have done for me during my schooling journey!
                    We all know that this has been a long time coming but the time is finally here.
                    Through the basic pre-reqs, to spending so much time in nursing, to social work then finally deciding on what i should've started with...Computer Science!
                    I love you guys with all of my heart and couldnt of done it without you whether you "made a impact" or not.Just being there was more than enough.
                    -Thank you.</p>     
             <p>Here's a cool slideshow i made with everyones pictures.. <a href="slideshow.html">My Support System</a></p>
